## Introduction

This project is deeply inspired by the classic mobile rhythm game **VOEZ**, aiming to build an open-source, sustainable, and community-content-driven rhythm game platform.

### Why this project?

As dedicated fans of VOEZ, I loved its unique dynamic lane mechanics and fluid gameplay experience. However, as the original game's updates slowed down or ceased, new official beatmaps became scarce. I didn't want this excellent game style to fade away. Therefore, I decided to create an open-source version from scratch, focusing on enabling players to load and play custom music and beatmaps.

### Goals

- To pay tribute to VOEZ's unique gameplay and visual style.
- To provide a stable, performant game client that supports player-made beatmaps.
- To establish an open and transparent development community where anyone who loves rhythm games, game development, or simply the VOEZ style can participate.

## Key Features

- **VOEZ-Style Dynamic Lane Gameplay**: Recreating and continuously improving the core VOEZ mechanics, including dynamically changing lanes and mutiple note types.
- **Support for Custom Music and Beatmaps**: A core functionality. Allow players to import their own music and beatmaps for gameplay.
- **Open-Source and Based on osu!framework**: The entire project code is open-source, built upon the osu!framework, providing a solid foundation for rhythm game development.
- **Early Playable Build**: The project is currently in the early stages of development, but it already has basic game functionality and can load beatmaps for gameplay.

## Prohect Status & Notes

This project is currently in **Early Development** phase.

- The core gameplay loop is implemented, allowing beatmaps to be loaded and played.
- The gameplay experience is under continuous refinement and optimization. It might not feel perfectly natural or smooth yet, requiring significant testing and adjustments.
- Features are still incomplete, and you may encounter bugs or missing details compared to the original game.
- APIs and internal structures may undergo significant changes.

Your testing feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!
